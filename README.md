# Customer Churn Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn in a bank dataset to uncover key factors influencing whether customers stay or leave. Using **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)**, the notebook performs data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to better understand customer behavior.

# Key Features
- Data preprocessing: handling missing values, duplicates, and irrelevant columns.  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):  
  - Distribution of churned vs. retained customers  
  - Demographic and account-related factor analysis  
- Visualizations using **Seaborn & Matplotlib** to highlight patterns in customer churn.  
- Insights into features that contribute most to churn decisions.  

# Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

# Future Scope
- Apply **machine learning models** for churn prediction.  
- Build a dashboard for real-time churn monitoring.
